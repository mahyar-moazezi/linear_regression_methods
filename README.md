# Linear Regression in Machine Learning
This repository contains various implementations of linear regression in machine learning using different techniques. Linear regression is a widely used statistical modeling technique that aims to establish a linear relationship between independent variables and a dependent variable. It is commonly used for tasks such as prediction, forecasting, and understanding the relationships between variables.

# Implementations
The repository provides the following implementations of linear regression:

Ordinary Least Squares (OLS): The OLS method is a classic approach to estimating the parameters of a linear regression model. It minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the observed and predicted values. In this repository, you will find an implementation of OLS using Python and NumPy.

Gradient Descent: Gradient descent is an iterative optimization algorithm used to minimize the cost function of a model. It is a popular method for training linear regression models when dealing with large datasets. This repository includes an implementation of gradient descent in Python.

Scikit-learn Library: Scikit-learn is a powerful machine learning library in Python that provides a comprehensive set of tools for various tasks, including linear regression. This repository offers examples of linear regression using scikit-learn, demonstrating how to utilize its functions and features.
